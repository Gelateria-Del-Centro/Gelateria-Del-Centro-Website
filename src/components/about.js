					<h2>OUR WHY?</h2>
					<p>
						At Gelateria Del Centro, our business is more than gelatoâ€”it's a
						reflection of the passion and vision of my co-owner, Tami Waters &
						myself. Tami is a seasoned interior designer, and I am an
						entrepreneur deeply rooted in Downtown Fresno's community.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our inspiration arose from a shared commitment to elevate downtown
						Fresno's cultural landscape by infusing the charm of Italian gelato
						into the historic Warnors Center. Tami's eye for aesthetics and
						dedication to preserving heritage paired seamlessly with my
						entrepreneurial spirit and community-driven mindset. Together, we
						envision Gelateria Del Centro as a place where art, history, and
						delectable flavors converge.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our dream was not just to offer exceptional gelato but to craft a
						space where locals and visitors alike could indulge in a timeless
						experience.
